<!--
    This will be a form that the user will use to create meals. It will suggest a photo, or ask
    for one. Maybe some sort of engine query taking images and asking if it fits the meal. This is
    also where users will put in ingredients, serving size, and other pertinent details. Possible use
    of an AI model to generate user tailored cooking instructions, if possible/plausible.
